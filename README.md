# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. The dataset includes information such as title, release year, duration, director, ratings, and more. We explore various trends related to content distribution, ratings, duration, and popular actors/directors. Additionally, we provide a filtering mechanism that allows users to select movies based on specific preferences.

## Dataset
We utilized two Netflix datasets from Kaggle and then created a **JSON file** with additional metadata. Our final file is an **HTML file** where users can find all the analysis.

## How to Use
1. **Download the final HTML file**, which contains all the analysis.
2. Open the file in a web browser or Jupyter Notebook to explore insights without re-running the code.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed to work with the dataset:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud
- TextBlob
- JSON
- Folium
- NetworkX
- itertools
- collections (Counter)

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix's movie and TV show catalog, uncovering trends related to content distribution, ratings, durations, and popular actors/directors. The filtering mechanism helps users personalize their movie selection based on preferences. 

For further improvements, additional datasets can be integrated to enhance the filtering system and provide more advanced insights.
